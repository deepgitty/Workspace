     * The "super" keyword.
     *
     * Consider List<? super Type>
     * The wildcard declaration of List<? super Integer> foo3 means that any of these are legal assignments:
     * 1. List<? super Integer> foo3 = new ArrayList<Integer>();  // Integer is a "superclass" of Integer.
     * 2. List<? super Integer> foo3 = new ArrayList<Number>();   // Number is a superclass of Integer
     * 3. List<? super Integer> foo3 = new ArrayList<Object>();   // Object is a superclass of Integer
     *
     * READING:
     * Given the above possible assignments, what type of object are you guaranteed to receive when you read from foo3:
     * 1. You aren't guaranteed an Integer because foo3 could be pointing at a List<Number> or List<Object>.
     * 2. You aren't guaranteed an Number because foo3 could be pointing at a List<Object>.
     * 3. The only guarantee is that you will get an instance of an Object or subclass of Object (but you don't know
     * what subclass).
     *
     * WRITING:
     * Given the above possible assignments, what type of object could you add to List foo3 that would be legal for all
     * the above possible ArrayList assignments:
     * 1. You can add an Integer because an Integer is allowed in any of above lists.
     * 2. You can add an instance of a subclass of Integer because an instance of a subclass of Integer is allowed in
     * any of the above lists.
     *
     * 3. You can't add a Double because foo3 could be pointing at a ArrayList<Integer>.
     * 4. You can't add a Number because foo3 could be pointing at a ArrayList<Integer>.
     * 5. You can't add a Object because foo3 could be pointing at a ArrayList<Integer>.
     *
     * PECS:
     *
     * Remember PECS: "Producer Extends, Consumer Super".
     *
     * "Producer Extends" - If you need a List to produce T values (you want to read Ts from the list), you need to
     * declare it with ? extends T, e.g. List<? extends Integer>. But you cannot add to this list.
     *
     * "Consumer Super" - If you need a List to consume T values (you want to write Ts into the list), you need to
     * declare it with ? super T, e.g. List<? super Integer>. But there are no guarantees what type of object you may
     * read from this list.
     *
     * If you need to both read from and write to a list, you need to declare it exactly with no wildcards, e.g. List<Integer>.
